Pyrofluid
=========

An interactive Unity gpgpu fluid simulation

Super quick getting started instructions:

1) open up the fluid test scene
2) press the play button
3) the game view is boring, so probably switch to the scene view and pan around. You can move obstacles and the fluid should respond appropriately.
4) you can change fluid simulation properties on the fluid manager gameobject
5) you can change visualization properties on the Ray Marching Box gameobject
